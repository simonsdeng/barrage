The game, Barrage (potential name), was coded by Simon Deng, Nikhil Ghosh, and Vikram Idury

The primary objective of the game is to amuse the user. In the game, the player must survive through waves of enemies, while protecting his “power node”. The game has two primary phases: the Build Phase where the player can build defenses and upgrade equipment, and the Combat Phase where the enemies will pour in and attempt to destroy the node. The player controls a wizard on screen with various abilities to fight enemies. Additionally, there are different types of defenses that serve a variety of purposes from simply blocking enemy paths, to firing bullets at them. There are different kinds of enemies that each interact with the player in a different way. As the waves progress, enemies will get tougher, but the player will also earn access to better abilities and defenses. The goal is to survive as many waves as possible before the node is destroyed. The wizard can die, but will not respawn for a given time period, leaving the node guarded only by the defenses set up.

The wizard is moved around the field with the WASD keys, which is viewed from the top angle. The wizard will aim his/her spells in the direction of the user’s mouse. Spells can be switched using the number keys, or the scroll wheel. To place defenses, the mouse is pointed at the intended location. The mouse is also used to navigate the various menus in the game.
